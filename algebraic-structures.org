* Algebraic Structures Tutorials

A catalog of tutorials written on algebraic structures. Feel free to do a PR/raise an issue if you know of any stellar tutorials on it.

** Monoids

A neat tutorial that introduces how monoids can be used to make code with reduce/fold operation cleaner.

** Monads

*** Garlandus

A good tutorial that first introduces group theory and algebraic structures before delving into the details on monads.
This way, a somewhat natural progression can be seen on how the ideas got motivated and emerged into Category Theory.
The part about duals and natural transformations are well written.
