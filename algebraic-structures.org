* Algebraic Structures Tutorials

A catalog of tutorials written on algebraic structures. Feel free to do a PR/raise an issue if you know of any stellar tutorials on it.

** Monoids

*** [[http://www.tomharding.me/2016/11/03/monoid-est-tonoid/][Monoid Est Ton Oid (2016)]]
A neat tutorial that introduces how monoids can be used to make code with reduce/fold operation cleaner.

** Monads

*** [[https://garlandus.co/OfGroupsAndMonads.html][Of Groups and Monads (2018)]]
*** Garlandus

A good tutorial that first introduces group theory and algebraic structures before delving into the details on monads.
This way, a somewhat natural progression can be seen on how the ideas got motivated and emerged into Category Theory.
The part about duals and natural transformations are well written.

Dan Ghica

A nice article that outlines how monads can be used both at the meta-language level and object-language level. Also, addresses how Moggi’s framework was adapted to Haskell and the nuances of evaluation strategies Haskell has when adopting monads along with lazy evaluation.
