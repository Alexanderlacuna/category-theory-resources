* Category Theory Resources

[[./img/category-theory-cover.png]]

This is a curation of introductory materials aimed at an enthusiast who wants to learn Category Theory. I have only recently gotten into learning Category Theory and as a result this list is only a partial sampling of the great wealth of materials out there. Please send a [[https://twitter.com/prathyvsh][tweet]], if you think I have missed out some great work in the field in this repo.

* Why learn Category Theory?

Category Theory is considered by many to be an involved domain of study to get into. It becomes a ground for unification of mathematical ideas from a wide variety of domains. And the way it achieves this is by taking an abstract vantage point on the ideas, their properties, and processes in these disciplines.

This abstract viewpoint is both the strength and weakness of the approach. The abstract nature of the subject makes it very powerful by giving it the generality to unite very different fields of study such as say topology and computation. But at the same time this abstract nature means that it becomes a rather tough endeavour to make its bearings on concrete subjects of study. It makes it hard to elucidate these without first learning enough terminology and understanding to set up a framework for discourse for the discipline under the study.

Category theory in certain communities of practice has moved towards being the heart of capturing the correspondences across different systems. One of the papers that catalogues the gems from taking this vantage point is the [[https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf][Rosetta Stone paper]] by John Carlos Baez and Mike Stay.

In this paper they detail how disparate domains like physics, topology, logic, and computation show strong parallels between their concepts. As can be seen in the diagram, they point out the parallels between these domains of study. Seen this way, Category Theory gives a language and a setting to talk about working concepts in different domains of inquiries and unifies them using higher level abstractions.

Ultimately, as Christopher Strachey put it, the divide between theory and practice is artificial and injurious. For doing computing both to be put together in a symbiotic circle to make each other a fertile field of knowledge and action. Category Theory in this manner is a subject whose keen study will payoff in the form of better decision-making in your day-to-day jobs. To articulate exactly how this is something a bit elusive to me at the moment, I am only seeing glimpses of how the concepts give me a way to talk about ideas happening in my daily programming. As I’m a learner only trying to come in terms with the deep implications Category Theory has on my work, I will need some more time to reframe this section to articulate the benefits of Category Theory in the long term.

So this repository is a curation of the best resources that come across my way and that has helped me in understanding the lay of the land better. Hope you enjoy going through it as much as I enjoyed in putting it together. Happy learning!

Category Theory is a field of study that emerged in around 1940s. By that time, the tangled web of inquiries in mathematics had accumulated many ideas from other fields. The inventors used Category Theory as a ground for unifying these different ideas under a common set of abstractions by studying these broad ranging ideas deeply. It was invented by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane to study algebraic topology, where they wanted to introduce the idea of natural transformation to make tractable the idea of functors between functors (A functor is a category theoretical term that roughly means functions between functions).

If you enjoy reading the history of the subject before diving into it, I highly recommend this accessible work by Garlandus [[https://garlandus.co/OfGroupsAndMonads.html][describing the emergence of Category Theory]]. Garlandus’ essay holds a high place in my mind, it is the kind of work that gives a sufficient background on the field discussing details of how it took shape as a result of contributions from multiple people. He locates Hilbert’s Göttingen as a central locus that lead to the germination of work on Category Theory.

Now, seeing that the subject emerged from algebraic topology, the application to Computer Science may seem arbitrary. But this came after deep investigations into computational structures and programming since around 1960s, where multiple links between algebra, automata, computational control/data structures, recursion schemes were unearthed. If you are interested in knowing about it more deeply, I have a [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/morphisms-of-computational-structures][repo]], which is a work in progress, where I try to unravel these links. A curious fact that I have to mention is that, one of the co-inventors of Category Theory, Samuel Eilenberg, went on to apply his ideas to automata after inventing Category Theory!

Now that we have seen how Category Theory came around, let us look at the resources that may grant us a working knowledge of the subject.

* Overview

Because of the standing of Category Theory as a general domain of inquiry, I have constantly felt it better to first get a cursory knowledge in functional programming and abstract algebra before tackling the subject. These paradigms are closer to the work done in Category Theory and if you come around to Category Theory without having some concrete experience in some problems where you can map the ideas you learn here, I feel it might be a bit hard to connect with this domain of study and intuition into to why such machinery is needed.

So I proceed to recommend some resource that might help you develop some functional programming knowledge before you come around to Category Theory.

** [[https://htdp.org][How to Design Programs (First Edition)]]

How to Design Programs is an accessible introduction to functional programming. The book is thorough in its coverage of essential ideas and slowly walks a novice through exercises to understand the concepts and how to put them to use in practical problems that one may encounter in their daily practice.

** Introduction to Functional Programming

Introduction to Functional Programming by Richard Bird and Philipp Wadler is a more formal treatment of functional programming. They use the language Miranda to elucidate the concepts.

** Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

SICP by Abelson and Sussman is considered a classic text that provides a synthesis of great ideas of computer science using LISP. It is a natural second choice once you have mastered the ideas in HtDP.  

Choose one or all books there will give you a solid footing in functional programming. With that knowledge under your belt, next step is to develop sufficient understanding of the field of mathematics. This knowledge would make the transition into CT much more smooth as there are deep links within CT that lead you onto very different domains and having a well-rounded knowledge of the field would help you.

To make this case, let me first mention this book by Saunders Mac Lane, the co-inventor of the field where he captures the ideas of mathematics in a comprehensive way. This book doubles out as an atlas of mathematical inquiry as there are multiple schemas in this book that give you a map on how to navigate the whole field. Such is the kind of breadth and depth that has gone into building Category Theory. I don’t mean this as something to intimidate the reader, but just to provide the awareness that the field is vast and finds application in many areas, computation being one among many. Mastery of all these fields is not a pre-requisite to be proficient in it. But just pointing out the fact that the masters of the subject have done great explorations of the field to bring forth the fruits of Category Theory.

Category Theory is the study of structures and for this purpose, I find it most important to have an overview of the field in a visual manner. Many of the ideas being talked about in Category Theory spawns dynamic pictures of morphisms in my head, but I find it hard to visualize them as there is so little Category Theory with pictures around. To start seeing how the pieces fit together one has to recourse to abstract diagrams and try to connect the concepts with how the same concepts model things in a more visual domain, say topology. One resource that I have aided me in this is Boris Marinov’s guide. Let me draw your attention to this incomplete but beautiful work by Boris Marinov: https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/

Now with focus to computation, the route I have taken is to learn abstract algebra which undergirds the algebraic species that are often talked about in Category Theory. To make sense of them, let me mention a few books. It is not mandatory reading, if you want to dive first into Category Theory, in fact some of the books that I have put together here allows one to learn Category Theory without much prerequisite knowledge but Abstract algebra is the one that I have felt is most proximate and has helped me create a ground for mapping back the ideas I learn from Category Theory.

1/ A Book of Abstract Algebra by Charles Pinter

This book by Charles Pinter reads not like a textbook but like a description of the field.

2/ A Concrete Approach to Abstract Algebra by W. W. Sawyer

A narrative approach for Abstract Algebra is given by Sawyer by focussing on concrete applications.

3/ Visual Group Theory by Nathan Carter

Visual Group Theory by Nathan Carter gives an overview of the field by relying on visualizations. His playground for the cayley diagram explorations gives a good idea of the quality of work that has gone into producing this book.

I will try to expand on this catalogue once I have better perspective, but these three seem to be the most promising to get a good overview of the algebraic structures.

Once this is done, I’ll recommend starting with Category Theory texts. These works helps an enthusiast to get through the field to understand it deeper.
